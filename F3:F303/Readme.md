Samples for STM32F303 
=================================

Some simplest of these samples works with [my non-solder devboard](https://github.com/eddyem/stm32samples/tree/master/F0_F1_F3-LQFP48_testboard)

- **ADC** - work with ADC
- **blink** - simple LEDs blink on PB0 and PB1
- **CANusb** - USB-CAN adapter
- **floatPrintf** - work with floats, convert floating point number into a string
- **I2C_scan** - simple I2C scanner
- **Multistepper** - stepper motor controller (8 independend motors or up to 64 multiplexed)
- **NitrogenFlooding** - automatic nitrogen flooding
- **PL2303** - emulates PL2303 (old concept)
- **Seven_CDCs** - 7 CDCs in one device
- **usart1** - read data from USART1 and send it back (blocking sending)
- **usart1fullDMA** - USART1 Rx and Tx DMA access (Rx terminated by character match of '\n' or buffer overflow).
- **usarts** - work with all three USARTs with Tx DMA, send to USART1 data read from other, you can send "2\n" or "3\n" to USART1 for tests of USART2/USART3
- **USB_template** - old USB PL2303 template
- **USB_template_CDC** - new USB-CDC template
